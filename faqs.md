# Frequently Asked Questions
* Why ext4 and not [insert filesystem here]?

Most filesystems sugessted are either:
1. Too old (ex: ext2)
2. Unsupported
3. Have their own snapshot system (btrfs or xfs)

* Why "ObsidianOS" as the name?

It sounds cool and this distrobution is made to be as solid as obsidian.

* Where can I ask more questions?
